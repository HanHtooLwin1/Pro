                In her story, Fanny is someone who doesn’t know to give up. Fanny never thought that life would be limited because she was a human. For a long time, Fanny has always dreamed of flying. And of course, this dream was laughed at by those around him.<br>
                <br>
                Then Fanny tried to make up her mind and created a tool in the form of a steel hook and long rope. With the tool he created, he could throw himself over a cliff and make him fly.<br>
                <br>
                With this tool, Fanny then has a hope that she can fly according to what she dreams of. Fanny then continued to practice and threw the tool at all the walls around her.<br>
                <br>
                Finally Fanny can get used to and adjust to the tool and make herself fly here and there from one cliff and another very quickly.<br>
                <br>
                Of course, the efforts his Fan put in to enable him to fly were not in vain. Not only the cliffs around Fanny, he also started going to higher cliffs to practice. Fanny can now fly even higher.<br>
                <br>
                After that, everyone had seen that Fanny who was an ordinary human could fly. All of these people then dub Fanny as the “Blade of Freedom” which has the artist as the freedom to conquer big dreams.<br>
                <br>
                From Fanny's story above, we can conclude that it doesn’t matter how big the dreams you have. If you keep trying, your dream will come true one day. The point is and never give up and do whatever you think is right.<br>
