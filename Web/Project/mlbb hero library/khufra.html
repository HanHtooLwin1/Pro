            <p>
                Deep in the Land of Dawn, lies an ancient city hidden in the desert. That place is the Western Desert. The city is very sturdy and for centuries never by the desert.
                Many scientists have conducted research on the ancient city which is the place in the seal of the cruel ruler named Khufra.<br>
                <br>
                Khufra is the ruler of the city, he is famous for his greed for power. Khufra also led an army called Arnak who was very strong in conquering the Western Desert and became the sole ruler.
                After years of expanding his territory, he has now acquired the power he now has. It doesn't stop there, he has a desire to expand his territory again.
                But in the middle of the journey, Khufra is blocked by the Moniyan Empire which is very strong and difficult to conquer.<br>
                <br>
                After that, Khufra tried to find more powerful people, and then he married Eslora who was one of the first Archaeologists in the Land of Dawn.
                Eslora uses magic power that can give Khufra great magic, until finally Khufra can get even greater power.
                With this new power, he wanted to conquer not only the Western Desert, but the entire Land of Dawn.<br>
                <br>
                Khufra always asked Eslora for strength to get much greater power, with this, Khufra became a leader who was very blinded by power and hated by his own people.
                After seeing Khufra getting greedy for power, Eslora then tried to save Khufra. One night, Khufra hugged Khufra who had a bigger body.<br>
                <br>
                Then Eslora performs a magic spell which makes Khufra feel pressured by a greater power. Eslora tries to end Khufra's blindness by selling him.
                Khufra was then sealed and did not think that Eslora did that, then Eslora cried because she had to do this to her husband.
                Khufra was sealed in a slumber in an ancient city, to commemorate this, Eslora also built a very large monument so that Eslora wanted Khufra not to be recorded as a garden king and cruel to power.<br>
                <br>
                After hundreds of years had passed, a cataclysmic event occurred and caused a high wave of an Orb. This wave wakes Khufra, then he is very angry at what Eslora did.
                He then vows to take revenge and find Eslora and wants to conquer the Land of Dawn once again and become a powerful leader.<br>
                <br>
                So that’s all for the story of Khufra in Mobile Legends. Pretty stressful isn’t it? He has an evil story but is also tragic because he has been betrayed by his lover. Keep practicing, play wisely and don't become a toxic player!<br>
