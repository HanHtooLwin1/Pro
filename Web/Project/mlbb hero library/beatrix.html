                <br><br>
                In a place called Castle Gorge which is part of the Moniyan Empire, there is a child named Beatrix, she is the son of a very respected merchant in the city.
                <br><br>
                Beatrix’s family business is extraordinary which makes her one of the richest people in the Land of Dawn.
                <br><br>
                However, Beatrix’s parents often traveled to trade throughout the Land of Dawn, so they had to leave Beatrix for success.
                <br><br>
                Then Beatrix herself was raised by a servant named Morgan, she really trusted Beatrix’s parents, and was loyal to serve the family.
                <br><br>
                Beatrix has very luxurious facilities like the rich in general, then she is also raised by Morgan. Then Beatrix grew into a child who was very free but often mischievous.
                <br><br>
                But one day, he was tired of playing with all the facilities from his house, so he wanted to try something new.
                <br><br>
                Fortunately, Beatrix’s parents had returned from the west and brought Beatrix a gift of a very sophisticated tool made from the city of Eruditio.
                <br><br>
                After getting these sophisticated tools, Beatrix then became interested in technology, then made a very obsessed with it.
                <br><br>
                With that in mind, Beatrix kept telling her servant Morgan to always travel to Eruditio to get more sophisticated items.
                <br><br>
                After years later, Beatrix then conducted an experiment, she and Morgan spent a very high cost but it worked, Beatrix has a very high talent for Technology items.
                <br><br>
                Over the years, Beatrix studied the concepts and structures of dynamics from a single source, which led to her building her own laboratory to conduct research on technology and weapons.
                <br><br>
                Then at the age of 16, Beatrix then went to the city of Eruditio, where she planned to gain more knowledge and skills about science and technology.
                <br><br>
                As is well known, Leviathan is a very cutting-edge technology that makes Beatrix obsessed with technology, she is very excited to learn about it.
                <br><br>
                A few years later, Beatrix lived her life at the Scholars Union in Eruditio. Beatrix quickly mastered all the knowledge and skills she taught. This made everyone call Beatrix a genius.
                <br><br>
                However, Beatrix’s thirst for technology seems to provide a problem, she realizes that in that place, the Trial Scholars are stuck on old principles. This makes Beatrix feel bored with the material being taught.
                <br><br>
                Later, Beatrix was eager to learn Leviathan technology and then worked with Dr. Rooney. He is a very famous scientist in Eruditio.
                <br><br>
                But to be a student is not easy. Beatrix had to prove that she really deserved it. Well one day, Beatrix attended a debate and then came up with a brilliant idea.
                <br><br>
                In the debate, Beatrix said that the human body can be connected by a communication terminal. It can create a neurological connection with other humans.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, after he announced his idea, Beatrix was immediately expelled by the Scholar Union. Because the idea that was put forward by Beatrix was similar to the work of the 1718 Laboratory.
                <br><br>
                Then after that, Beatrix returned to Castle Gorge and then chose to develop her own technology together with her servant Morgan.
                <br><br>
                Half a year later, Beatrix Technology was finally created. He created a Survival Nexus competition, which safely allowed participants to take control of a virtual avatar and control it.
                <br><br>
                This technology is made for participants who compete tactically without any physical risk. Quickly, the competition is very popular with many people and even players can get big prizes.
                <br><br>
                Beatrix was very proud of her technology, but it didn’t last long. One of the scientists from the 1718 Laboratory hacked Beatrix’s technology. These actions put several players under his control.
                <br><br>
                All the robots in Beatrix’s technology are controlled by hackers, and are aimed at attacking Eruditio. Then there was a great attack that befell the city.
                <br><br>
                Dr. Rooney and also the Eruditio Guardian then use all the power they have to defend the city.
                <br><br>
                But on the other hand, Beatrix did not accept the existence of the hacker, she then helped Dr. Ronney to save Eruditio.
                <br><br>
                With the hard work of Beatrix, Dr. Rooney and Guardian Eruditio, finally the attacking robots have been defeated. The action he then made Dr. Rooney is very impressed with Beatrix.
                <br><br>
                Beatrix was then allowed to return to Eruditio and the goats specifically by Dr. Rooney, hearing this Beatrix was very happy and later became a contributor in the development of Technology in the city.
                <br><br>
                So that’s it for the story of Beatrix’s hero in Mobile Legends. Hopefully the above story can be entertaining and useful for all of you. See you! Keep practicing, play wisely and don’t become a toxic player!
