                The story of Franco in Mobile Legends starts from a frozen sea land and very far from the Land of Dawn. The sea was eternally frozen and almost every year Franco and his people felt the eternal chill of snow.
                This distant and frozen country is called Nost Gal. It has land of ice and snow and it is quite impossible to live in, but the country has developed into a peaceful village and inhabited by many sea people.<br>
                <br>
                They daily look for food to support their group to live in Nost Gal, live happily and of course safe and very far from various problems and threats of war.
                However, one day Nost Gal arrives a pirate group led by Bane. Bane himself came to the land of Nost Gal to destroy and also eliminate the peace that was there. Instantly Bane became the ruler of Nost Gal.
                Of course, Franco did not remain silent, he swore together with his friends to oppose and bring peace back to his homeland. Franco opposes Bane and continues to try to destroy Bane and his pirate group.<br>
                <br>
                Franco's desire is only one, he wants to re-create peace in the Land of Nots Gal and return to live in peace and safety as before. Of course this is not an easy dream for Franco.
                Oops, unfortunately that's all the Franco Mobile Legends story currently circulating on the internet. However, it can be learned from the story above, that Franco is a good person, but there is someone who destroys the place he was born in and then looks for strength to take revenge and restore his peace.
                The enemy in Franco's story is Bane who is a pirate in the Mobile Legends story. Of course, pirates are a group of bad people and of course it's different from the One Piece anime which is told to be kind.<br>
                <br>
                To achieve peace again one day the story of Franco in Mobile Legends will continue until Franco and his friends regain peace in the Land of Nost Gal.
                That's all for the Story of Franco Mobile Legends, hopefully the above reviews can be useful especially for those of you who are Mobile Legends gamers. Hopefully this is useful and see you soon. Don't forget to keep practicing, play wisely and don't become a toxic player!
