                It is said that there is a clan called the Shura Clan in Mobile Legends. The Shura Clan itself is a Clan that has grown in isolation for countless generations. The men from these Shura Clans were renowned for being the bravest warriors in the world, and the women from their Shura Clans for being the greatest beauties.
                In the main belief of the Shura Clan there is a legend called the Three Thousand Worlds. This legend tells the story of the Secret World for Three Thousand years. One has to face various levels of psychic trials and advance to the world after this world itself has gained a victory.<br>
                <br>
                It was these people from the Shura Clan who had found a way to enter this world. And only those who managed to conquer the three thousand worlds would get the title of Ashura. But in the Three Thousand Sura Clan’s history, no one has succeeded in conquering all of them.<br>
                <br>
                In his strong ambition and determination, the story of Martis ML trains every day diligently and diligently. He did it all in his life to grow into a strong figure. Martis continued to break through the world which if he succeeded in conquering all of them would become a strong Ashura figure. No one knows how many years it will be before Martis reaches the final secret world.<br>
                <br>
                Even though he had experienced several defeats, Martis’ determination did not waver and made him try even harder to achieve his goal, to become the strongest Ashura. Martis finally fought with the devil from the secret world and he managed to conquer his Three Tounsand World Secret. Since then he has become the “Ashura King” who commands as many as tens of Million Ashuras who have high determination and enthusiasm.<br>
                <br>
