        <div class="story">
            <p>
                Since chou was born into the world, his life is far from decency. He lives in a slum area full of poor people. The location of this area is very far from urban development. Every day, this hero lives a simple and very sad life.
                Even though life is full of contradictions, he remains a friendly person and likes to help people in need. As a result, many people in the area where he lives view him as a good role model.
                If anyone needs help, he is happy to help both children and parents. He asked for nothing in return and helped those he helped build.<br>
                <br>
                However, one day those peaceful days suddenly changed when an event occurred in the vicinity of the Land of Dawn. The incident even affected his hometown. The impact of the riot destroyed the area where he lived.
                Amidst the chaos, Chou ML happens to meet a nun and a monk whose situation is really bad. His condition was full of wounds due to being chased by a group of criminals who wanted to catch him. When they meet him, they don't realize that they are both still being chased by thugs.<br>
                <br>
                Having a spirit of helping since childhood, Chou ML decides to fight against all bad guys. With the abilities he has, he is able to easily beat them all.
                When he saw the condition of the seriously injured nuns and monks, he took them to his home and nursed them until they recovered.<br>
                <br>
                The monk was very grateful to him for protecting him and taking care of him until he recovered. As a token of his gratitude, this Monk wanted to learn the martial art of kung fu.
                He promised to use the knowledge the monks had learned to help many people who were in trouble without asking for anything in return or favour. 
                That was the information about the story Chou ML, a kung fu master whose goal in life is to establish justice throughout the world. <br>
                <br>
                So that's all for the story of Khufra in Mobile Legends. Pretty stressful isnâ€™t it? He has an evil story but is also tragic because he has been betrayed by his lover. Keep practicing, play wisely and don't become a toxic player!<br>
